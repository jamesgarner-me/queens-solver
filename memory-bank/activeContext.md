# Active Context: Queens Solver

## Current Work Focus

The Queens Solver project has successfully implemented AWS API Gateway integration. This work enhances the deployment architecture and ensures proper routing of API requests in different environments.

The project has recently enhanced its error handling with a dual-layer approach that covers both client-side and server-side errors. This work improves user experience by providing meaningful error messages in various failure scenarios.

Key focus areas:
1. Implemented AWS API Gateway for backend API access
2. Ensured environment-specific configurations (development (local) and production)
3. Maintained local development capabilities
4. Documented the new infrastructure setup
5. Implemented comprehensive error handling at both client and server levels
6. Created custom error pages for common HTTP error codes (403, 404, 500)
7. Added CloudFront error response handling for infrastructure-level errors
8. Developed React error page component for application-level errors
9. Enhanced test coverage for error scenarios

## Recent Changes

The following changes have been implemented to support AWS API Gateway integration:

1. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Enhanced environment-specific configuration files (`.env.development` and `.env.production`)
   - Improved `config.ts` to better handle different environments with explicit environment type checking
   - Updated `apiService.ts` with a more robust API request function that handles environment-specific configurations
   - Added environment variable placeholders for API Gateway IDs and regions

2. **Backend Updates**:
   - Enhanced `config.py` with environment variables and stage awareness
   - Updated `main.py` to support API Gateway stages, improved logging, and added a health check endpoint
   - Modified `lambda_function.py` for better AWS Lambda integration with API Gateway
   - Completely restructured `template.yaml` to properly configure API Gateway with stages (dev, prod)
   - Implemented Lambda layers for Python dependencies management

3. **CI/CD Improvements**:
   - Fixed Lambda layer deployment in the backend CI workflow
   - Implemented S3-based dependency management for Lambda layers
   - Added proper error handling and validation in CI/CD workflows
   - Configured environment variables for Lambda functions
   - Enhanced CORS configuration to enable cross-origin requests

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created `README-API-GATEWAY.md` with detailed instructions for deployment and usage
   - Documented common issues and troubleshooting steps
   - Updated memory bank with current deployment architecture

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Created `ErrorPage.tsx` React component for application-level errors
   - Added static HTML error pages (403.html, 404.html, 500.html) for infrastructure-level errors
   - Implemented proper unit tests for the ErrorPage component
   - Updated CloudFront configuration to use custom error pages

## Next Steps

1. **Deployment and Testing**
   - ✅ Deploy the updated infrastructure to AWS (production environment)
   - ✅ Test API Gateway integration in all environments (dev (local), prod)
   - ✅ Verify CORS configuration is working correctly
   - ✅ Ensure local development still functions as expected

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for API Gateway and Lambda
   - Analyze logs for performance bottlenecks
   - Consider implementing X-Ray tracing for request tracking

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Review API Gateway security settings
   - Consider implementing API keys for rate limiting
   - Evaluate WAF integration for additional protection

4. **Documentation Refinement**
   - Update system architecture diagrams to reflect new infrastructure
   - Create deployment guides for all environments
   - Document CI/CD pipeline integration with the new infrastructure

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **API Gateway Stage Management**
   - Using separate stages (dev (local), prod) for different environments
   - Each stage has its own configuration and deployment
   - CloudFront distribution is configured to use the appropriate stage

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Backend uses `ENVIRONMENT` and `API_STAGE` to determine behavior
   - Frontend uses `.env.*` files to configure API endpoints
   - Placeholder variables need to be replaced with actual values during deployment

3. **CORS Configuration**
   - API Gateway has explicit CORS configuration for OPTIONS requests
   - Backend allows origins based on environment
   - Frontend uses appropriate credentials mode for cross-origin requests

4. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Three environments: development (local), and production (AWS)
   - AWS Lambda provides good scalability but has cold start issues
   - API Gateway stages allow for isolated testing before production deployment

5. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Dual-layer approach with both infrastructure and application-level handling
   - Static HTML error pages for CloudFront/S3 errors (infrastructure layer)
   - React component for application routing errors (app layer)
   - Consistent styling and messaging across all error types
   - Clear user recovery path from all error states

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**
   - Clear separation between services (API, game logic, solving)
   - Component-based frontend architecture
   - Type safety throughout the codebase
   - Environment-specific configuration

2. **Error Handling**
   - Enhanced logging with environment context
   - Graceful degradation when API issues occur
   - User-friendly error messages at both infrastructure and application levels
   - Static HTML fallbacks when JavaScript fails to load
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Consistent visual styling across all error states

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Unit tests for core algorithms
   - Component tests for UI elements
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Environment-specific testing

4. **Documentation Standards**
   - Comprehensive memory bank for project context
   - Code comments for complex algorithms
   - Type definitions for all data structures
   - Detailed deployment and configuration documentation

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **API Gateway Integration**
   - API Gateway stages provide isolation between environments
   - CORS configuration is critical for frontend-backend communication
   - Lambda integration requires specific IAM permissions
   - CloudFront can be used to provide a consistent domain for API access

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Environment variables should be clearly defined and documented
   - Placeholder values should be used for sensitive or deployment-specific values
   - Local development should mimic production as closely as possible
   - Logging should include environment context for easier debugging

3. **Frontend-Backend Communication**
   - API request abstraction improves maintainability
   - Environment-specific configuration simplifies deployment
   - CORS handling is critical for cross-origin requests
   - Error handling should be consistent across environments

4. **Project Evolution**
   - Started as a simple solver, evolved to include full API integration
   - Frontend added to provide visual representation
   - Deployment to AWS Lambda for serverless operation
   - Now includes proper API Gateway integration for production use

5. **Error Handling Best Practices**
   - Infrastructure-level errors should be handled before the application loads
   - Application-level error handling provides better context and interactivity
   - Static HTML fallbacks ensure errors are communicated even when JavaScript fails
   - Consistent styling and recovery options improve user experience
   - Test coverage for error scenarios is essential for reliability
