# Active Context: Queens Solver

## Current Work Focus

The Queens Solver project is currently in the initial documentation phase. The memory bank is being established to provide a comprehensive understanding of the project's purpose, architecture, and technical implementation.

Key focus areas:
1. Documenting the project's core requirements and goals
2. Establishing the system architecture and design patterns
3. Defining the technical context and development environment
4. Setting up a framework for tracking progress and next steps

## Recent Changes

As this is the initial setup of the memory bank, there are no previous changes to document. The memory bank is being created with the following core files:

1. `projectbrief.md` - Defining core requirements and goals
2. `productContext.md` - Explaining why the project exists and how it should work
3. `systemPatterns.md` - Documenting system architecture and design patterns
4. `techContext.md` - Detailing technologies used and development setup
5. `activeContext.md` (this file) - Tracking current focus and decisions
6. `progress.md` - Monitoring project status and remaining work

## Next Steps

1. **Code Review and Analysis**
   - Thoroughly review existing codebase
   - Identify any gaps between documentation and implementation
   - Document any undocumented features or technical debt

2. **Testing and Validation**
   - Verify the functionality of the existing solution
   - Test with various LinkedIn puzzle configurations
   - Document edge cases and potential failure points

3. **Enhancement Planning**
   - Identify opportunities for improving the solver algorithm
   - Consider UI/UX improvements for better visualization
   - Explore options for handling API changes from LinkedIn

4. **Documentation Refinement**
   - Update memory bank files based on deeper code analysis
   - Add specific examples and screenshots
   - Create additional context files for complex features if needed

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **API Stability**
   - LinkedIn's puzzle API is undocumented and subject to change
   - Need to monitor for changes and implement robust error handling
   - Consider implementing a fallback mechanism or manual input option

2. **Algorithm Optimization**
   - Current backtracking approach works but may be optimized
   - Evaluate performance on larger board sizes
   - Consider alternative algorithms for specific puzzle configurations

3. **User Experience**
   - Balance between automatic solving and educational value
   - Consider adding step-by-step solution visualization
   - Evaluate accessibility of the current UI implementation

4. **Deployment Strategy**
   - AWS Lambda provides good scalability but has cold start issues
   - Monitor usage patterns to optimize deployment configuration
   - Consider alternative deployment options if usage increases

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**
   - Clear separation between services (API, game logic, solving)
   - Component-based frontend architecture
   - Type safety throughout the codebase

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation when API issues occur
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Unit tests for core algorithms
   - Component tests for UI elements
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows

4. **Documentation Standards**
   - Comprehensive memory bank for project context
   - Code comments for complex algorithms
   - Type definitions for all data structures

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **LinkedIn API Interaction**
   - GraphQL-based API requires specific query structure
   - Authentication via CSRF token and cookies
   - Response format includes nested data that requires careful extraction

2. **N-Queens Problem Constraints**
   - LinkedIn's version adds color region constraints
   - Backtracking algorithm needs to account for these additional constraints
   - Optimization by processing smallest regions first improves performance

3. **Frontend Visualization**
   - Chessboard-style grid with color regions
   - Need for clear indication of queen placements
   - Challenge of representing both the puzzle and solution clearly

4. **Project Evolution**
   - Started as a simple solver, evolved to include full API integration
   - Frontend added to provide visual representation
   - Deployment to AWS Lambda for serverless operation
