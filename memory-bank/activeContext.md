# Active Context: Queens Solver

## Current Work Focus

The Queens Solver project has successfully implemented AWS API Gateway integration. This work enhances the deployment architecture and ensures proper routing of API requests in different environments.

Key focus areas:
1. Implemented AWS API Gateway for backend API access
2. Ensured environment-specific configurations (development (local) and production)
3. Maintained local development capabilities
4. Documented the new infrastructure setup

## Recent Changes

The following changes have been implemented to support AWS API Gateway integration:

1. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Enhanced environment-specific configuration files (`.env.development` and `.env.production`)
   - Improved `config.ts` to better handle different environments with explicit environment type checking
   - Updated `apiService.ts` with a more robust API request function that handles environment-specific configurations
   - Added environment variable placeholders for API Gateway IDs and regions

2. **Backend Updates**:
   - Enhanced `config.py` with environment variables and stage awareness
   - Updated `main.py` to support API Gateway stages, improved logging, and added a health check endpoint
   - Modified `lambda_function.py` for better AWS Lambda integration with API Gateway
   - Completely restructured `template.yaml` to properly configure API Gateway with stages (dev, prod)

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created `README-API-GATEWAY.md` with detailed instructions for deployment and usage
   - Documented common issues and troubleshooting steps

## Next Steps

1. **Deployment and Testing**
   - Deploy the updated infrastructure to AWS (production environment)
   - Test API Gateway integration in all environments (dev (local), prod)
   - Verify CORS configuration is working correctly
   - Ensure local development still functions as expected

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for API Gateway and Lambda
   - Analyze logs for performance bottlenecks
   - Consider implementing X-Ray tracing for request tracking

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Review API Gateway security settings
   - Consider implementing API keys for rate limiting
   - Evaluate WAF integration for additional protection

4. **Documentation Refinement**
   - Update system architecture diagrams to reflect new infrastructure
   - Create deployment guides for all environments
   - Document CI/CD pipeline integration with the new infrastructure

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **API Gateway Stage Management**
   - Using separate stages (dev (local), prod) for different environments
   - Each stage has its own configuration and deployment
   - CloudFront distribution is configured to use the appropriate stage

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Backend uses `ENVIRONMENT` and `API_STAGE` to determine behavior
   - Frontend uses `.env.*` files to configure API endpoints
   - Placeholder variables need to be replaced with actual values during deployment

3. **CORS Configuration**
   - API Gateway has explicit CORS configuration for OPTIONS requests
   - Backend allows origins based on environment
   - Frontend uses appropriate credentials mode for cross-origin requests

4. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Three environments: development (local), and production (AWS)
   - AWS Lambda provides good scalability but has cold start issues
   - API Gateway stages allow for isolated testing before production deployment

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**
   - Clear separation between services (API, game logic, solving)
   - Component-based frontend architecture
   - Type safety throughout the codebase
   - Environment-specific configuration

2. **Error Handling**
   - Enhanced logging with environment context
   - Graceful degradation when API issues occur
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Unit tests for core algorithms
   - Component tests for UI elements
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Environment-specific testing

4. **Documentation Standards**
   - Comprehensive memory bank for project context
   - Code comments for complex algorithms
   - Type definitions for all data structures
   - Detailed deployment and configuration documentation

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **API Gateway Integration**
   - API Gateway stages provide isolation between environments
   - CORS configuration is critical for frontend-backend communication
   - Lambda integration requires specific IAM permissions
   - CloudFront can be used to provide a consistent domain for API access

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Environment variables should be clearly defined and documented
   - Placeholder values should be used for sensitive or deployment-specific values
   - Local development should mimic production as closely as possible
   - Logging should include environment context for easier debugging

3. **Frontend-Backend Communication**
   - API request abstraction improves maintainability
   - Environment-specific configuration simplifies deployment
   - CORS handling is critical for cross-origin requests
   - Error handling should be consistent across environments

4. **Project Evolution**
   - Started as a simple solver, evolved to include full API integration
   - Frontend added to provide visual representation
   - Deployment to AWS Lambda for serverless operation
   - Now includes proper API Gateway integration for production use
