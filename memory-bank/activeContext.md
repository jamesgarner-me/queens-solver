# Active Context: Queens Solver

## Current Work Focus

The Queens Solver project is currently focused on infrastructure improvements, specifically implementing AWS API Gateway integration. This work aims to enhance the deployment architecture and ensure proper routing of API requests in different environments.

Key focus areas:
1. Implementing AWS API Gateway for backend API access
2. Ensuring environment-specific configurations (development and production only)
3. Maintaining local development capabilities
4. Documenting the new infrastructure setup

## Recent Changes

The following changes have been implemented to support AWS API Gateway integration:

1. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Created environment-specific configuration files (`.env.development`, `.env.production`)
   - Enhanced `config.ts` to better handle different environments
   - Added environment-specific build scripts to `package.json`

2. **Backend Updates**:
   - Enhanced `config.py` with environment variables and stage awareness
   - Updated `main.py` to support API Gateway stages and improved logging
   - Modified `lambda_function.py` for better AWS Lambda integration
   - Completely restructured `template.yaml` to properly configure API Gateway with stages

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created `README-API-GATEWAY.md` with detailed instructions for deployment and usage

## Next Steps

1. **Deployment and Testing**
   - Deploy the updated infrastructure to AWS (production environment)
   - Test API Gateway integration in both development and production
   - Verify CORS configuration is working correctly
   - Ensure local development still functions as expected

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for API Gateway and Lambda
   - Enhance logging for better troubleshooting
   - Consider implementing X-Ray tracing for request tracking

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Review API Gateway security settings
   - Consider implementing API keys for rate limiting
   - Evaluate WAF integration for additional protection

4. **Documentation Refinement**
   - Update system architecture diagrams to reflect new infrastructure
   - Create deployment guides for development and production environments
   - Document troubleshooting procedures

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **API Stability**
   - LinkedIn's puzzle API is undocumented and subject to change
   - Need to monitor for changes and implement robust error handling
   - Consider implementing a fallback mechanism or manual input option

2. **Algorithm Optimization**
   - Current backtracking approach works but may be optimized
   - Evaluate performance on larger board sizes
   - Consider alternative algorithms for specific puzzle configurations

3. **User Experience**
   - Balance between automatic solving and educational value
   - Consider adding step-by-step solution visualization
   - Evaluate accessibility of the current UI implementation

4. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Two environments only: development (local) and production (AWS)
   - AWS Lambda provides good scalability but has cold start issues
   - Monitor usage patterns to optimize deployment configuration
   - Consider alternative deployment options if usage increases

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**
   - Clear separation between services (API, game logic, solving)
   - Component-based frontend architecture
   - Type safety throughout the codebase

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation when API issues occur
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Unit tests for core algorithms
   - Component tests for UI elements
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows

4. **Documentation Standards**
   - Comprehensive memory bank for project context
   - Code comments for complex algorithms
   - Type definitions for all data structures

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **LinkedIn API Interaction**
   - GraphQL-based API requires specific query structure
   - Authentication via CSRF token and cookies
   - Response format includes nested data that requires careful extraction

2. **N-Queens Problem Constraints**
   - LinkedIn's version adds color region constraints
   - Backtracking algorithm needs to account for these additional constraints
   - Optimization by processing smallest regions first improves performance

3. **Frontend Visualization**
   - Chessboard-style grid with color regions
   - Need for clear indication of queen placements
   - Challenge of representing both the puzzle and solution clearly

4. **Project Evolution**
   - Started as a simple solver, evolved to include full API integration
   - Frontend added to provide visual representation
   - Deployment to AWS Lambda for serverless operation
