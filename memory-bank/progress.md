## Current Status

The Queens Solver project is currently in a **functional but basic state**. The core functionality is implemented and working:

1. The backend can successfully:
   - Authenticate with LinkedIn
   - Fetch the current day's Queens puzzle
   - Parse the puzzle data
   - Solve the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm
   - Return the solution via a RESTful API

2. The frontend can successfully:
   - Fetch puzzle and solution data from the backend
   - Display the puzzle board with color regions
   - Show the solution with queen placements
   - Handle loading and error states

3. The infrastructure has been enhanced with:
   - Properly configured Lambda layer for Python dependencies
   - Improved CI/CD workflow for backend and frontend deployment
   - CORS configuration to enable cross-origin requests between CloudFront and API Gateway
   - Environment variables configuration for different deployment stages

The project is usable in its current form but has opportunities for enhancement in terms of user experience, performance, and additional features.

## Known Issues

1. **LinkedIn API Stability**
   - The LinkedIn API is undocumented and may change without notice
   - Changes to the API structure or authentication mechanism could break functionality

2. **Solver Performance**
   - The current backtracking algorithm may be slow for very large board sizes
   - No performance benchmarking has been conducted to identify bottlenecks

3. **Error Handling**
   - Limited user feedback for specific error conditions
   - No automated retry mechanism for transient API failures

4. **UI Limitations**
   - Basic visualization without animations or step-by-step solving
   - Limited accessibility features
   - No dark mode support

5. **Testing Coverage**
   - Incomplete test coverage for edge cases
   - Limited automated testing for frontend components

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach
- Started as a simple script to solve N-Queens puzzles
- Used a basic backtracking algorithm without optimization
- Command-line interface for input and output

### First Evolution
- Added LinkedIn API integration to automatically fetch puzzles
- Implemented color region constraints specific to LinkedIn's version
- Optimized solver algorithm to prioritize smaller regions first

### Second Evolution
- Developed FastAPI backend to expose RESTful endpoints
- Created React frontend for visualization
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states

### Third Evolution
- Deployed to AWS using Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and CloudFront
- Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Implemented CORS configuration to enable proper communication between frontend and backend

### Current Direction
- Focus on stability and robustness
- Improving deployment architecture and CI/CD workflows
- Ensuring reliable dependency management through Lambda layers
- Addressing cross-origin resource sharing for secure API access
- Documenting the system thoroughly via memory bank

### Future Considerations
- Potential expansion to other LinkedIn puzzle types
- Exploring alternative solving algorithms for performance
- Adding educational features to explain the solving process
- Implementing user accounts to track solving history
