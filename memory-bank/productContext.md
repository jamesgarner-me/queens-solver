# Product Context: Queens Solver

## Why This Project Exists

LinkedIn offers daily puzzles to its users, including the Queens puzzle, which is based on the classic N-Queens problem in computer science. While these puzzles are designed to be engaging mental exercises, they can sometimes be challenging and time-consuming to solve manually. The Queens Solver project exists to:

1. **Save Time**: Provide immediate solutions to LinkedIn's daily Queens puzzles
2. **Demonstrate Algorithmic Efficiency**: Showcase how computational approaches can efficiently solve complex puzzles
3. **Educational Value**: Help users understand the N-Queens problem and backtracking algorithms
4. **Convenience**: Offer a simple tool for users who enjoy seeing the solution without spending time on manual solving

## Problems It Solves

1. **Time Constraints**: Users may not have time to solve the puzzle manually but still want to see the solution
2. **Difficulty Barrier**: Some puzzles may be too challenging for casual users
3. **Verification Need**: Users might want to verify their own solutions
4. **Learning Opportunity**: Provides a practical example of algorithmic problem-solving for educational purposes
5. **API Complexity**: Abstracts away the complexity of interacting with LinkedIn's API to retrieve puzzle data

## How It Should Work

### User Flow

1. **Access**: User visits the Queens Solver application
2. **Initialization**: The application automatically fetches the current day's Queens puzzle from LinkedIn
3. **Visualization**: The original puzzle board is displayed to the user
4. **Solution**: The application automatically solves the puzzle and displays the solution
5. **Interaction**: User can view both the original puzzle and the solution

### Technical Flow

1. **API Interaction**: Backend service authenticates with LinkedIn and retrieves the current puzzle
2. **Data Processing**: The puzzle data is parsed and transformed into a suitable format
3. **Algorithm Execution**: The solver algorithm processes the puzzle to find a valid solution
4. **Data Transfer**: Solution data is sent to the frontend
5. **Rendering**: Frontend displays both the original puzzle and the solution

### Key Features

1. **Automatic Retrieval**: No need for users to manually input puzzle data
2. **Visual Representation**: Clear visualization of the puzzle board and solution
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API issues or unsolvable puzzles
4. **Responsive Design**: Accessible across different devices and screen sizes

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: Minimal user interaction required to get results
2. **Clarity**: Clear presentation of puzzles and solutions
3. **Speed**: Fast retrieval and solving of puzzles
4. **Reliability**: Consistent performance and accurate solutions
5. **Accessibility**: Usable by people with varying technical expertise

## Target Users

1. **LinkedIn Users**: People who play LinkedIn's daily puzzles
2. **Puzzle Enthusiasts**: Those interested in algorithmic puzzle-solving
3. **Computer Science Students/Educators**: People learning or teaching about algorithms
4. **Time-Constrained Professionals**: Users who want to see solutions without spending time solving

## Success Metrics

1. **Accuracy**: Percentage of puzzles correctly solved
2. **Speed**: Time taken to retrieve and solve puzzles
3. **Usability**: Ease of understanding the presented solution
4. **Reliability**: Uptime and error rate when interacting with LinkedIn's API
